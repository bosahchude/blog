I've been programming for over 10 years and I haven't given too much thought to
typing speed. It's just something I haven't cared about--until recently.
Since I dabbled into the world of Data Science where every project usually ends
with a detailed report of the work done. Typing reports has made me reevaluate
the way I see typing speed as an asset for coders.

So far, I've found that having a less than decent typing speed is kind of a big
deal. When writing only code, your typing speed does matter but not as much
because you spend 80% of your time thinking and debugging your code and the
other 20% of your time is when you get to apply your typing skills. Even still,
you get a nice boost thanks to the refactoring tools available in most modern
IDEs.

When typing a report, it's a whole different ball game. Reports are the bogeyman
of programmers. Nobody wants to get stuck doing them. They are boring yet they
have to be precise and there is no room for error.

Having a good speed can certainly make the data analysis and reporting process
a lot more enjoyable. I've seen reports that should take maximum of 5 hours
stretch into 18 hours debacle because the programmer is typing like a snail,
grinding out words at 20wpm.

Some research on typing speed says that only half of the
population has the finger dexterity to exceed 50wpm. I'm not okay with that.
No matter your job description, you should strive to type at 70wpm. That should
be the minimum.

If you aren't typing at that 70wpm yet, you should pick up one
of the tools I recommend below. They are open source, command-line based tools
that would help you the way they have helped me improve my typing skills.

The typing tutors I recommend are:

1. [GNU Typist](https://www.gnu.org/software/gtypist/index.html)
2. [Typespeed](http://typespeed.sourceforge.net/)

Unlike generic typing tutors out there like Mavis Beacon, these two apps are
multiplatform, extremely lightweight and customizable to the core. I've used
them extensively and I like to go over what I like about them.

## GNU Typist

Amazing--the only word that really describes this piece of software. If you're
just learning to touch type, there is no better tool out there for you.

With resources for typist of all levels, GNU Typist removes the distraction
involved with traditional typing tutors, leaving you with nothing but your white
text on a black background which helps with concentration.

Here's what I like most about GNU Typist:

1. Support for alternative keyboard layouts including Dvorak and Colemak.
2. Extremely lightweight (<500kb).
3. Multiplatform and Open Source (Take that Mavis Beacon!).
4. Hands down the best touch typing course I've ever seen. Unlike other typing
tutors, GNU Typist focuses on teaching you the most used characters and vowels
so you're typing full words and sentences after just learning the positions of only
10 characters on the keyboard.
5. Comes with detailed documentation that show you how to plug in special
languages or custom lessons.

## Typespeed

[Typespeed](http://typespeed.sourceforge.net/) fills a void that I felt was really lacking in GNU Typist--Games.
Seriously, whoever thought leaving out games from GNU Typist was a good idea
need to question their need to suck the fun out of life.

If you already know how to touch type and you're just looking for a 3 minute
non-commitment during a rest to blow off steam, Typespeed is your best friend.

The beauty of Typespeed is that you get to familiarize yourself with any
programming language of choice while also having fun. It comes with presets of
C# keywords, Dos and Unix Commands. You can also add the keywords of a programming
language, framework or platform. You can even add those curly and square brackets
`[] {}` that slow programmers down a lot.

I've added most of the Python and R keywords to my Typespeed and it has really
helped with remembering things in addition to improving speed.

### Summary

Improve your typing skills with [GNU Typist](https://www.gnu.org/software/gtypist/index.html)
and [Typespeed](http://typespeed.sourceforge.net/). Don't be stuck in a
state of 'Terminal Mediocrity', whatever your typing speed is, you could always
add more WPM.

The time savings from having a fast typing speed piles up. Leaving
the office at 5pm instead of 6pm might not matter much at first glance but when
you add up the potential time savings over the period of a year, it becomes
quite significant.
